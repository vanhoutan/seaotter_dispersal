2. Entry verification:
        Data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI Model 6000 and 6600 datasonde 
and graphs are produced and examined using the Ecowatch program software. Data 
are also uploaded in a comma-delimited format from the YSI to the PC. Edited 
files are created by removing headers, footers, and spaces on a PC in Excel 5.0. 
Suspect data are evaluated using QA/QC Excel 5.0 macros (version 3.0) from CDMO.
The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically format 
column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI 
sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data 
logger generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do 
not contain data with periods, and find all data points that fall 
outside the range of what the data logger is designed to measure 
(outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow PC users with 30-
minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a two-week 
deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing 
users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a 
monthly basis. Edited and raw data are archived at Elkhorn Slough NERR then 
uploaded to CDMO NERR server. John Haskins is responsible for the editing and 
archiving of data.

3. Research objectives:
        Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a three to four week period 
at four sites in Elkhorn Slough. One site South Marsh (SM) is in a relatively 
unimpacted side channel of the slough and the second, Azevedo Pond (AP) is in a 
pond that receives fertilizer and pesticide runoff from an adjoining strawberry 
field. The third site, North Marsh (NM), was added in April 1999 and is located 
in an area where there is both agricultural and non-agricultural runoff. The 
fourth site Vierra Mouth, added March 14, 2001, is located at the mouth of the 
slough and is used to identify oceanic influence. The purpose of this research 
is to identify the base parameters for Elkhorn Slough by using South Marsh as 
the control site and the other three sites are impacted sites and monitored for 
possible future problems.  

4. Research methods: 
        The Elkhorn Slough water-monitoring program began in July 1995. All 
four sites described above are monitored simultaneously. Prior to YSI 
deployment at SM, a 20-foot length of 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was placed in the 
slough to house the YSI. Holes were drilled in the pipe to remove 10% of the 
pipe's surface area and to allow water flow across the YSI. The pipe was 
positioned vertically in the slough with one end pushed into the soft bottom 
sediments and the other end secured to shore. A bolt in the pipe maintains the 
YSI exactly one foot (30cm) above the bottom. This setup is exactly the same at 
North Marsh.  Prior to YSI deployment at AP, a supportive framework of rope and 
PVC was placed at the site to house the YSI. The structure maintains the YSI 
exactly one foot (30cm) above the pond bottom. Every half hour over a 30-day 
period, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, 
temperature, depth, turbidity, and pH are recorded. 30-day periods were chosen 
due to the limitations of the dissolved oxygen membrane and battery power. 
        At the end of each 30-day period, the YSI is brought back into the lab 
for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Data is downloaded on PC and 
graphs are printed using the PC 6000 software.  Sonde body and probes are 
cleaned.  DO membrane is changed and allowed to re-equilibrate for at least 
eight hours before calibration.  Calibration is performed as outlined in the YSI 
manual.  Buffer solutions of pH 7 and pH 10 are purchased from a scientific 
supply house and used for two-point calibration of the pH probe.  A salinity 
standard of 31.892 ppt was used for calibration of the conductivity probe and in 
the beginning of July 1999 a conductivity standard of 53 mS/cm was used. The 
turbidity probe is calibrated using a two-point calibration with DI water and 
100 NTU standard. As of July 1998 a new YSI is calibrated in the lab in order to 
replace the previous one in the field. This eliminates the loss of data due to 
cleaning and calibration. QA/QC is done according to the CDMO manual by John 
Haskins using the macros provided by the CDMO.  Data are then looked over more 
rigorously to identify and document anomalies and missing data.  

5. Site location and character:
        
Elkhorn Slough is located on the West Coast of the United States in 
Central California. It connects with the Pacific Ocean in central Monterey Bay 
near Moss Landing, California. There are three sampling sites.  SM (South 
Marsh) is in a side channel of the slough and is relatively unimpacted by 
anthropogenic influences.  The YSI is located on the side of a bank in one of 
the secondary slough channels.  AP (Azevedo Pond) (36º 50' 44.64"N, 121º 45' 
13.24" W) is in a pond that receives fertilizer and pesticide runoff from a 
strawberry field in year-round production. The YSI is located about 10m from a 
culvert connecting the pond to the slough. Tide ranges from 0 to 1.3 meters, 
salinity ranges from 8.8 during heavy runoff to 41 ppt during strong 
evaporation, the sonde is located approximately 30 cm off the bottom, the 
bottom habitat is silty mud. Depth for this site is approximately 1 meter. NM 
(North Marsh) (36º 50' 4.75" N, 121º 44' 18.33" W) is located in between South 
Marsh and Azevedo Pond. This site is impacted by both agricultural and urban 
runoff. With a mean depth of 1 meter, the tidal range is approximately 0.4 
meters., salinity ranges between 20 and 40 parts per thousand, there is 
freshwater runoff from agriculture and upland runoff. The sonde is approximately 
30 cm off the bottom and the bottom habitat is silty mud. SM (South Marsh) (36º 
49' 05.00"N, 121º 44' 21.83" W) is located approximately 3 km south of NM and is 
surrounded by mostly reserve land. This site receives runoff mostly from uplands 
and some from cattle ranches. This site receives the least amount of pollution. 
The tidal range from 0 to 3 meters, the salinity range is from 22 to 36 parts 
per thousand and is approximately 30 cm off the bottom. The bottom is slightly 
compacted silty mud.  Depth for this site is approximately 2 meters. The fourth 
site VM (Vierra Mouth) (36º 48' 39.95" N, 121º 44' 45.40" W) is located at the 
mouth of the slough and is used to identify oceanic influence. With a mean depth 
of 2.5 meters, the tidal range is from 0 to 3.2 meters, salinity ranges from 26 
to 34 parts per thousand and the sonde is located approximately 30 cm off the 
bottom. The bottom habitat is compacted mud and sand because there are strong 
tidal currents. This site receives drainage from the entire watershed since it 
is at the mouth. There are several auto wreaking yards located approximately 2 
km east of this site. 


6. Data collection period:
Sampling at the South Marsh and Azevedo Pond sites began simultaneously at the 
end of June 1995 and data collection is ongoing. North Marsh began sampling on 
April 15 1999. Vierra Mouth began sampling on March 14, 2001.

8. Associated researchers and projects:
	Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Elkhorn Slough 
Foundation have had an ongoing program to monitor estuarine water quality in the 
central Monterey Bay region since 1988.  Currently, 24 stations are monitored 
monthly for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, nitrate, 
ammonium and dissolved inorganic phosphate concentrations.  Two of these 
stations on the Reserve are about 400 m from the SM site.  Data collection began 
at these two stations in September 1989.  A monthly monitoring station is 
also located at Azevedo Pond within 10 m of the YSI deployment.  Monthly data 
from the Azevedo Pond are available from March 1992.
	The University of California Santa Cruz Agro Ecology Program has an 
ongoing project to examine the effects of agricultural production on an adjacent 
wetland.  Matthew Werner, Marc Los Huertos, Felecia Rein, Sean Swezey, Mark 
Silberstein, Andrew De Vogelaere, Ron Tjeerdema have been the principal 
investigators.

11. Data Anomalies:

January 1-31, 2002 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Turbidity data are deleted from Jan 12 1530 through the end of the deployment 
Jan 28 1300 due to a probe malfunction. 

During the following periods turbidity data were anomalously high or negative, 
data deleted;
Jan 01	1900
Jan 02	1330
Jan 03	0800
Jan 28	2100-2200
Jan 31	1330

Salinity data was suspect from Jan 01 0000 through Jan 03 0930 because of probe 
drift, probably because of mud clogging the probe. Post deployment readings were 
48.48 in 53 ms/cm2.  Data were not deleted because readings were congruous with 
the following deployment.

There are no pH data Jan 01 0000  Jan 03 0930 because the probe was not 
installed on that deployment. 

North Marsh 
During the following periods turbidity data were anomalously high or negative;
Jan 04	1000
Jan 06	1300
Jan 09	0500
Jan 12	0430
Jan 13	1800
Jan 20	1500

From the beginning of the month to the end of the first deployment 6 NTU was 
added to the turbidity data because a poor zero calibration caused numerous 
negative readings.

South Marsh
All data are deleted from Jan 28 1630 through 2230 and Jan 29 1700 because 
salinity probe was out of water.

Turbidity data are missing from the beginning of the second deployment Jan 14 
1200 through the end of the month because probe was not deployed.

Turbidity data were deleted from Jan 08 1530 through the end of the first 
Deployment (01/14 1130) because of increasing probe drift.

PH data are suspect from the beginning of the month through the end of the first 
deployment because of a large jump in data from the end of the first deployment 
to the beginning of the second deployment (8.11 to 7.88).

DO% and DO mg/L data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment 
through Jan 27 because of an increase in data then leveling off.

Vierra Mouth
Turbidity data was deleted Jan 31 1430 because it was an outlier.

All turbidity data were deleted from the beginning of the month through the end 
of the first deployment Jan 07 1200 because no probe was deployed.

4 NTU was added to all turbidity data from Jan 7 1230 through the end of the 
month because numerous values were negative probably due to a poor calibration 
in DI.

DO% and DO mg/L data were deleted from the beginning of the month through the 
end of the deployment Jan 07 1200 because data were anomalously high.

All pH data are deleted from the beginning of the second deployment (01/07 1230) 
through the end of the month because of a malfunctioning probe.

February 1-29, 2002 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
A significant rain event occurred during feb 16 and 17 where 7 and 22 mm of rain 
fell. This effect caused low salinity and high turbidity data in Azevedo during 
these days. 

+ 2 NTU was added to turbidity data from the beginning of the month through the 
end of the first deployment (Feb 27 1430) because there were numerous negative 
values due to a poor calibration in DI.

+ 14 NTU was added to turbidity data from the beginning of the second deployment 
(Feb 27 1430 through the end of the month) because there were numerous negative 
values due to a poor calibration in DI.

North Marsh
The following turbidity data were deleted because they were anomalously high or 
negative;
Feb 1		2230
Feb 2		0730
Feb 3		1830, 0430
Feb 4		1400
Feb 5		0530
Feb 9		1030
Feb 18	1400, 1430

Turbidity data are missing during the second deployment (02/19 1130 through 
03/18 1100) because no probe was deployed.

The storm event also affected the salinity at this site, causing decreased 
salinity during low tides. 

South Marsh
Turbidity probe was not deployed for the first deployment thus there are no data 
from the beginning of the month through Feb 11 1200.

Salinity data were deleted from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the deployment Feb 11 1200 because the probe only read 45.67 in 53 ms/cm. 

The following turbidity data were deleted because they were anomalously high or 
negative;
Feb 21	1530
Feb 25	1100, 1330

Vierra Mouth
All data are missing from Feb 02 0730 through 1130 and from Feb 03 0100 through 
Feb 04 1130 due to a loss of data on the sonde for an unknown reason.

4 NTU was added to all turbidity data from the beginning of the month through 
the end of the deployment (Feb 02 0630) because numerous values were negative 
probably due to a poor calibration in DI.

4 NTU was added to all turbidity data from Feb 02 1200 through Feb 03 0030 
because numerous values were negative probably due to a poor calibration in DI.

19 NTU was added to all turbidity data from Feb 04 1200 through Feb 28 2330 
because numerous values were negative probably due to a poor calibration in DI.

The following turbidity data were deleted because they were anomalously high or 
negative;
Feb 06	1830
Feb 07	1200-1230, 1930
Feb 08	0430, 1800
Feb 09	1400 - 1430
Feb 21	1330

DO data were deleted from Feb 15 0800 through the end of the month due to a 
membrane puncture that happened at this time.

DO data are suspect at the beginning of the month through the end of the first 
deployment (02/04 1130) because there is a discontinuity between the end of the 
first deployment and the beginning of the second deployment. The data were not 
deleted because the post deployment check was 103% in 100% saturated air.

All pH data are deleted from the beginning of the first deployment through end 
of deployment 02/02 0630 because of a malfunctioning probe.

All ph data are deleted 02/02 1200 through 02/03 0030 because of a 
malfunctioning probe.

March 1-30, 2002 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
+ 14 NTU was added to turbidity data from the beginning of the month through the 
end of the first deployment (Mar 25 1200) because there were numerous negative 
values due to a poor calibration in DI.

Turbidity data were deleted from the beginning of the second deployment (03/25 
1230) though the end of the month because no probe was deployed.

The following turbidity data were deleted because they were anomalously high or 
negative;
Mar 10	1100
Mar 14	0700
Mar 22	0930

There was a significant decrease in salinity corresponding to a significant rain 
event (14 mm) on Mar 17.

North Marsh 
Turbidity data are missing during the second deployment (02/19 1130 through 
03/18 1100) because no probe was deployed.

December 1-31, 2002 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
December was a very wet month in this area and during this month. A total of 160 
mm of rain fell for the month. This had significant effects on water quality at 
our sites especially salinity and turbidity in Azevedo Pond. Most of the rain 
fell from Dec 13 through Dec 21 (127 mm).

Turbidity data were deleted from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment, Dec 02 1130. 

The following turbidity data were deleted because they were anomalously high or 
negative;
Dec 10     08:30
Dec 14     16:30-17:30

Dec 28     12:30 
Dec 29     01:30

North Marsh 
Temperature data is suspect from the beginning of the second deployment through 
Dec 20 1030 because they are low and erratic compared to the rest of the month. 

Salinity data are suspect from Dec 09 through Dec 13 approximately 2030. This 
was when the rains were hitting the heaviest and the salinity probe was probably 
clogged with sediment and the increased flows may have released the 
sediment. After this time the salinity probe appears to function properly and is 
congruous with the following deployment. 

DO data are suspect from Dec 13 0400 through the end of the first deployment 
because data are not congruous with the following deployment and appear to be 
muted. 

pH data are suspect towards the end of the first deployment because the are not 
congruous with the following deployment.

2 NTU was added to all turbidity data the entire month because numerous values 
were negative probably due to a poor calibration in DI.

Turbididty data was deleted from Dec 06 1000 through Dec 08 1800 because there 
were numerous high values probably because wiper was not parking properly 

The following turbidity data were deleted because they were anomalously high or 
negative;
Dec 04    	  2130
Dec 05	  1130
Dec 13 	  2030
Dec 14	  1330-1400, 2000
Dec 15	  0330, 1400

Dec 17	  1600-1700

There were very high turbidity values which corresponded with high rain on Dec 
14 0600-1100.

South Marsh
Salinity data are suspect from the beginning of the month through approximately 
Dec 14 0000 because values are muted compared to the rest of the month for an 
unknown reason.

Depth data are suspect during the beginning of the month through the end of the 
first deployment because (12/16 1330) values are not congruous with the 
following deployment.

The following turbidity data were deleted because they were anomalously high or 
negative;

Vierra Mouth
Heavy rains during this month effected the salinity resulting in sharp decreases 
in salinity values during rain events.

DO data are missing from Dec 17 1530 through the end of the month because 
the membrane was punctured and there was a sharp decrease in the data at this 
time indicating this is when it occurred.

The following turbidity data were deleted because they were anomalously high or 
negative;

12. Missing Data:
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance and calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks/Notes:
A) There were a few instances at this NERR site where turbidity recorded small 
negative values (-0001 and -0002). Because turbidity has a range of accuracy of 
+/-2 NTU, the technician did not edit or deleted these values in any way. 

B) December was a very wet month in this area and during this month. A total of 
160 mm of rain fell for the month. This had significant effects on water quality 
our sites especially salinity and turbidity.
