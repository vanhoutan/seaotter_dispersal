2. Entry verification:
Data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI and graphs are produced and examined 
using the Ecowatch program software. Data are also uploaded in a comma-delimited 
format from the YSI to the PC. Edited files are created by removing headers, 
footers, and spaces on a PC in Excel 5.0. Suspect data are evaluated using QA/QC 
excel 5.0 macros (version 3.0) from CDMO. Missing data from YSI maintenance 
are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.). Edited files 
are merged to create one full month of data. Edited and raw data are archived at 
Elkhorn Slough NERR then uploaded to CDMO NERR server. John Haskins is 
responsible for the editing and archiving of data.

3. Research objectives:
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a three to four week period at four 
sites in Elkhorn Slough. One site, South Marsh (SM), is in a relatively 
unimpacted side channel of the slough and the second, Azevedo Pond (AP), is in a 
pond that receives fertilizer and pesticide runoff from an adjoining strawberry 
field. The third site, North Marsh (NM), was added in April 1999 and is located 
in an area where there is both agricultural and non-agricultural runoff. The 
fourth site, Vierra Mouth, is located at the mouth of the slough and is used to 
identify oceanic influence. This site was added March 14, 2001 at 1300. The 
purpose of this research is to identify the base parameters for Elkhorn Slough 
by using South Marsh as the control site and the other three sites are impacted 
sites and monitored for possible future problems.  

4. Research methods: 
The Elkhorn Slough water-monitoring program began in July 1995. All four sites 
described above are monitored simultaneously. Prior to YSI deployment at SM, a 
20-foot length of 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was placed in the slough to house the 
YSI. Holes were drilled in the pipe to remove 10% of the pipe's surface area and 
to allow water flow across the YSI. The pipe was positioned vertically in the 
slough with one end pushed into the soft bottom sediments and the other end 
secured to shore. A bolt in the pipe maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) 
above the bottom. This setup is exactly the same at North Marsh.  Prior to YSI 
deployment at Azevedo Pond, a supportive framework of rope and PVC was placed at 
the site to house the YSI. The structure maintains the YSI exactly one foot 
(30cm) above the pond bottom. Every half hour over a 30-day period, measurements 
of specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, depth, 
turbidity, and pH are recorded. 30-day periods were chosen due to the 
limitations of the dissolved oxygen membrane and battery power. At the end of 
each 30-day period, the YSI is brought back into the lab for downloading, 
cleaning, and recalibration. Data is downloaded on PC and graphs are printed 
using the PC 6000 software.  Sonde body and probes are cleaned.  DO membrane is 
changed and allowed to re-equilibrate for at least eight hours before 
calibration.  Calibration is performed as outlined in the YSI manual.  Buffer 
solutions of pH 7 and pH 10 are purchased from a scientific supply house and 
used for two-point calibration of the pH probe.  A salinity standard of 31.892 
ppt was used for calibration of the conductivity probe and in the beginning of 
July 1999 a conductivity standard of 53 mS/cm was used. The turbidity probe is 
calibrated using a two-point calibration with DI water and 100 NTU standard. As 
of July 1998 a new YSI is calibrated in the lab in order to replace the previous 
one in the field. This eliminates the loss of data due to cleaning and 
calibration. QA/QC is done according to the CDMO manual by John Haskins using 
the macros provided by the CDMO.  Data are then looked over more rigorously to 
identify and document anomalies and missing data.  

5. Site location and character:
Elkhorn Slough is located on the West Coast of the United States in Central 
California. It connects with the Pacific Ocean in central Monterey Bay near Moss 
Landing, California. The Slough drains 182 km2 and has most of the fresh water 
input from small creeks during the winter months. The watershed consists of a 
mixture of grazed, farmed, developed lands, and oak woodland and chaparral.  
There are four NERR sampling sites. The tidal range is approximately 6.5 ft., 
and salinity ranges between 29 and 34 part per thousand. 

VM (Vierra Mouth, Latitude = 36o48'39.96"; Longitude = 121o46'44.4") is 
approximately 4 meters at the entrance to slough, mostly muddy bottom with some 
clam and eel grass beds, and receives oceanic flushing as well as some inputs 
from Salinas River and Moro Cojo runoff. The YSI is located off the old concrete 
outflow of the now Duke Power outflow site. This site was added March 14, 2001 
at 1300

SM (South Marsh, Latitude = 36o 49'04.72"; Longitude = 121o 44'21.95") is 
approximately 2.5 m deep, has a muddy bottom, is in a side channel of the slough 
and is relatively unimpacted by anthropogenic influences.  The YSI is located on 
the side of a bank in one of the secondary slough channels.

AP (Azevedo Pond, Latitude = 36o 50'44.41"; Longitude = 121o 45'13.50") is 
approximately 1 m deep, has a muddy bottom, and is in a pond that receives 
fertilizer and pesticide runoff from a strawberry field in year-round 
production. The YSI is located about 10m from a culvert connecting the pond to 
the slough.

NM (North Marsh, Latitude = 36o 50'04.68", Longitude = 121o 44'18.19") is 
approximately 1 m deep, has a muddy bottom, is located in between South Marsh 
and Azevedo Pond. This site is impacted by both agricultural and urban runoff.

8. Associated researchers and projects:
	Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Elkhorn Slough 
Foundation have had an ongoing program to monitor estuarine water quality in the 
central Monterey Bay region since 1988.  Currently, 24 stations are monitored 
monthly for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, nitrate, 
ammonium and dissolved inorganic phosphate concentrations.  Two of these 
stations on the Reserve are about 400 m from the SM site.  Data collection began 
at these two stations in September 1989.  A monthly monitoring station is also 
located at Azevedo Pond within 10 m of the YSI deployment.  Monthly data from 
the Azevedo Pond are available from March 1992.
	The University of California Santa Cruz Agroecology Program has an ongoing 
project to examine the effects of agricultural production on an adjacent 
wetland.  Matthew Werner, Marc Los Huertos, Felecia Rein, Sean Swezey, Mark 
Silberstein, Andrew De Vogelaere, Ron Tjeerdema have been the principal 
investigators.

11. Data Anomalies (suspect data):

January 1-31, 2001 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
These turbidity data are suspect because they are either zero and/or negative:
Jan 01     14:00-14:30 
Jan 06     17:30, 20:30-21:00 
Jan 19     23:30 
Jan 20     20:30-21:00 
Jan 21     17:00 

Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment through 
the end of the month due to poor calibration. The probe was reporting negative 
values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration solution was most likely 
contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value of the minimum value 
detected (6 NTU) to all these data to bring them up above zero. This correction 
was applied to turbidity data from Jan 30 1430 through the end of this 
deployment Feb 27 1200.

These turbidity data are missing because the are anomalously high;
Jan 15	1100
Jan 16	1900
Jan 21	1630
Jan 24	0430
Jan 25	1800

The pH data are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of the 
month because these values are higher than the max pH recorded at this site 
suggesting the probe was poorly calibrated.


North Marsh 
Salinity data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment to Jan 24 
0500 because values were suppressed with minimal variability. Data were not 
deleted.

Depth data are suspect for the month (Jan 1 through Jan 15) because values are 
incongruous between deployments due either to drift or poor calibration. Data 
were not deleted.

These turbidity data are suspect because they are either negative or zero;

Jan 29     05:30, 07:00, 08:00-10:00 
Jan 30     10:00-10:30 
Jan 31     06:30

Turbidity data are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment January 02 08:30 because they are erratic due to probe 
malfunction.

pH data are missing because probe broke in the field beginning Jan 02 1000 
through the end of the deployment. Data deleted Jan 02 10:00 - Jan 15 08:30.

DO% and DO mg/L data are missing from Jan 06 0000 through the end of the 
Deployment Jan 15 08:30 because of a sharp decrease in readings indicating a 
small membrane 
puncture.


South Marsh
Turbidity data are suspect for these times because values are zero and/or 
negative:
Jan 04     18:00 
Jan 06     00:30 
Jan 07     08:30 
Jan 08     08:30 
Jan 09     10:00 
Jan 12     13:30 
Jan 14     21:00 
Jan 15     21:30 
Jan 16     04:30-05:00, 11:00, 15:00, 23:00 
Jan 18     00:30, 05:30-06:30 
Jan 19     01:00, 07:30

The pH data are suspect at the beginning of the month because values are 
incongruous between deployments due either to drift or poor calibration. 

Salinity data are suspect from January 2 1300 through 1730 because the values 
are drifting down and they are lower than the second deployment.

Turbidity data are missing during these times because they are high outliers;
Jan 04	1200
Jan 13	1700
Jan 18	0800

Turbidity data are missing from Jan 19 1200 through Jan 25 1300 when the 
batteries died because they are erratic due to a probe malfunction.

February 1-29, 2001 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
These depth data are suspect because they are either negative and/or zero;
Feb 13	1230-1330

Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment due to poor calibration. The probe was reporting negative 
values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration solution was most likely 
contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value of the minimum value 
detected (6 NTU) to all these data to bring them up above zero. This correction 
was applied to turbidity data from Jan 30 1430 through the end of this 
deployment Feb 27 1200.

Turbidity data is missing because it was anomalously high Feb 12 0900.

The pH data are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of the 
first deployment Feb 27 11:30 because values were higher than maximum pH for 
this site 
probably due to a poor calibration or poor standards. 

North Marsh 
These turbidity data are suspect because they are either negative or zero;
Feb 05     11:30, 14:30-17:30 
Feb 07     19:30 
Feb 08     14:30, 16:00, 17:00

Feb 11     06:00, 08:00, 09:00-09:30 
Feb 12     09:00-11:00

The turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment 
through the end of the month due to poor calibration. The probe was reporting 
negative values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration solution was most likely 
contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value of the minimum value 
detected (3 NTU) to all these data to bring them up above zero. This correction 
was applied to turbidity data from Feb 12 1300 through the end of this 
deployment Mar 02 1600.

These turbidity data were suspect and deleted because they are anomalously high:
Feb 09	1500
Feb 12	0700, 1230

South Marsh
All turbidity data are missing for the month because of poor calibration and 
erratic readings. 

The data for pH is missing Feb 05 1300 due to a poor first reading.

March 1-30, 2001 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Turbidity data are suspect during the following times because values were 
negative and/or zero:
Mar 20     00:30-01:00, 02:30, 04:00

Turbidity data are suspect for the entire month due to poor calibration. The 
probe was reporting negative values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration 
solution was most likely contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value 
of the minimum value detected (3 NTU for the first deployment and 4 NTU for the 
second deployment) to all these data to bring them up above zero. This 
correction was applied to turbidity data for the entire month adding 3 NTU to 
the first deployment data and 4 NTU to the second deployment data ending Apr 09 
0830.

Turbidity was missing Mar 12 1630 because it was a high outlier.

This was the first data for this site. Data for this month were compiled from 
two deployments. The first began March 14 1300 and ended March 24 1800. The 
second one began March 27 1500 and continued through the end of the month. 

Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment through 
the end of the month due to poor calibration. The probe was reporting negative 
values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration solution was most likely 
contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value of the minimum value 
detected (6 NTU) to all these data to bring them up above zero. This correction 
was applied to turbidity data from Mar 27 1500 through the end of this 
deployment Apr 23 0930.

All data are missing from the beginning of the month to the beginning of the 
first deployment Mar 14 1300 due to probe not being deployed. All data are also 
missing from Mar 24 1830 through Mar 27 1430 due to sonde calibration and 
repair. 

DO% and DO mg/L are deleted in the first deployment (Mar 14 1300 - Mar 24 1800) 
because of a poor calibration.

Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment Apr 09 0830 due to poor calibration. The probe was 
reporting negative values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration olution was most 
likely contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value of the minimum 
value detected (3 NTU) to all these data to bring them up above zero. This 
correction was applied to turbidity data from the beginning of the month through 
the end of the second deployment Apr 09 0830.

Salinity data are suspect from the beginning of the month through the end of the 
first deployment because the values are drifting down and they are lower than 
the second deployment.

Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment, May 7 0900 due to poor calibration. The probe was 
reporting negative values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration solution was 
most likely contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value of the 
minimum value detected (3 NTU) to all these data to bring them up above zero. 
This correction was applied to turbidity data for the first deployment from the 
beginning of the month through May 07 0900.

The pH data are missing from Oct 13 0230 to Oct 22 0730 because of probe 
malfunction because the data are not fluid and the probe appears to be in mud.

The following turbidity data are missing because they were high outliers;
Oct 02	2130
Oct 06	1230
Oct 08	0500-0530

Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment (Oct 15 
1030) through the end of the month because of a poor calibration. The probe was 
reporting negative values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration solution was 
most likely contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value of the 
minimum value detected to all these data to bring them up above zero (+12 NTU). 
This correction was applied to turbidity data from Oct 15 1030 through the end 
of the month. 

Salinity data are suspect towards the end of the first deployment because they 
are incongruous with the following deployment probably due to probe drift.  

Depth data are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of the 
first deployment Oct 15 1030 due to probe malfunction. A large discontinuity was 
apparent from Oct 15 onward possibly due to a poor calibration.  

DO% and DO mg/L are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment Oct 15 1030 due to previously mentioned membrane puncture.

The following turbidity data are missing because they are high outliers;
Oct 06	0100

November 1-31, 2001 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Salinity data are suspect from the end of the first deployment Nov 05 1200 and 
the beginning of the second deployment Nov 05 1230 due to data being slightly 
higher at the beginning of the second deployment than the end of the previous 
one. 

Depth data are suspect during the following times due to negative and/or zero 
readings:
Nov 06     01:30 
Nov 12     05:00 
Nov 21     22:30 
Nov 22     00:00, 01:00, 02:30-03:00 
Nov 23     01:00-04:00, 19:00-23:30 
Nov 24     00:00-04:30, 14:30-16:00, 20:30-23:30 
Nov 25     00:00-04:30 
Nov 28     04:00-05:00, 17:30-20:30 
Nov 29     20:00-21:30 
Nov 30     01:00-05:30
It was unable to be determined whether or not these data were negative because 
they were out of water or possibly because there was a low-pressure system in 
the area during these times.

All turbidity data were deleted for the entire month because of previously 
mentioned probe malfunction, and because the probe was not installed during the 
second deployment. 

All data are deleted from Nov 28 2330 through Nov 29 0530 due to a partial out 
of water event. 

North Marsh 
All pH data are missing for the entire month due to probe malfunction and 
therefore probe not being deployed.

The following turbidity data are missing because they were high outliers:
Nov 05	1800
Nov 08	1630
Nov 13	0800
Nov 14	1230-1300, 1430
Nov 15	1500
Nov 17	1630
Nov 18	0400, 0530, 0700-0730, 0830, 1900

Turbidity data are suspect during the following times due to negative readings:
11/27/2001	01:30:00 - 04:00:00

DO% and DO mg/L are suspect from Nov 02 1500-2300 because there is a gradual 
decline in the data. The problem was undetermined.

South Marsh
Turbidity data are suspect for the second deployment because of a poor 
calibration. The probe was reporting negative values indicating that the 0 NTU 
calibration solution was most likely contaminated. It was decided to add the 
absolute value of the minimum value detected to all these data to bring them up 
above zero (+18 NTU). This correction was applied to turbidity data from Nov 20 
1230 through Nov 28. 

All data are missing from Nov 15 1530 through Nov 20 1130 due to the PVC pipe, 
which was holding the sonde, slipped from its anchor and fell into the channel.  
The sonde was then reset 15 meters north along the same channel with the same 
PVC pipe. Depth was slightly deeper at this location. 

Salinity and Spec Cond. data are missing from Nov 10 1930 Nov 15 1500 because of 
probe drift.

These turbidity data were deleted because they were high outliers;
Nov 02	0200
Nov 08	0000
Nov 14	2300
Nov 20	1200

Turbididty data are missing Nov 28 1330 through the end of the month because of 
a probe malfunction.

Vierra Mouth
Salinity data are suspect from the beginning of the month through the end of the 
first deployment due to incongruous values with the next deployment. This is 
probably due to probe drift.

Turbidity data are suspect for the month because of a poor calibration. The 
probe was reporting negative values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration 
solution was most likely contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value 
of the minimum value detected to all these data to bring them up above zero (+12 
NTU) for the first deployment and +6 NTU for the second deployment. This 
correction was applied to turbidity data throughout the month. 

These pH data were deleted because they were low due to the probe breaking in 
the field; Nov 11 1600 through Nov 12 0930.

December 1-31, 2001 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Salinity data are suspect Dec 02 0600 through Dec 03 0600 and Dec 20 1730 
through Dec 21 1130 due to sharp decreases that were most likely due to rain 
events.

Turbidity data are suspect from Dec 20 1100 through Dec 21 1430 due to the same 
rain event.

These depth data are suspect because they are negative:
Dec 01     02:00-05:30, 22:30 
Dec 02     04:30-05:00

These turbidity data are suspect because they are negative and/or zero:
Dec 13     04:30, 05:30 
Dec 14     03:30-04:00 
Dec 16     02:00 

Turbidity data are missing during these times because they are high outliers;
Dec 14	0830
Dec 20	2000, 2300-2330
Dec 21	0100-0300
Dec 30	1530

All data are missing Dec 14 0200-0600 due to an out of water event.

Turbidity data are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment Dec 03 1500 due to probe not being deployed.

The pH data are missing from the beginning of the second deployment though the 
end of the month due to no probe being deployed.

North Marsh 
Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment (Dec 21 
1100) through the end month because they go negative on numerous occasions. This 
is most likely due to a poor calibration. A correction was added again to this 
data adding the absolute value of the minimum value detected during this period 
(3 NTU). This correction was applied to data from Dec 21 1100 through the end of 
the month. 

These turbidity data are missing because they are high outliers;
Dec 04	1400
Dec 06	0400, 0800, 1000, 1900

The pH data are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of the 
first deployment, Dec 21 1030 due to no probe being deployed.

DO % and DO mg/L were deleted Dec 01 00:00-06:00 because they were negative.

South Marsh
Data from the pH are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment Dec 17 
1500 through the end of the month because they are incongruous with previous 
deployment data.

Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment (Dec 17 
1500) through the end month because the data was negative on numerous occasions. 
This is most likely due to a poor calibration. A correction was added again to 
this data adding the absolute value of the minimum value detected during this 
period (8 NTU). 

All data were deleted from Dec 17 1730-2000 and Dec 18 1830-2000 because of an 
out of water event. 

Turbidity data are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment  Dec 17 1430 due to previously mentioned probe malfunction.

Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment (Dec 17 1430) because of a poor calibration. The probe was 
reporting negative values indicating that the 0 NTU calibration solution was 
most likely contaminated. It was decided to add the absolute value of the 
minimum value detected to all these data to bring them up above zero (+6 NTU). 

Data for pH are suspect towards the end of the first deployment because they are 
incongruous with the following deployment.

Turbidity data were deleted from the beginning of the second deployment Dec 10 
1100 to the end of the month because the probe was not deployed.

These turbidity data are suspect because they are negative:

12/07/2001	15:00:00

12. Missing data 

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks/Notes

Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
