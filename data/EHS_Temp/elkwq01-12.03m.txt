2. Entry verification:
Deployment data are uploaded from the YSI data logger to a Personal Computer 
(IBM compatible). Data plots are produced and examined and erroneous data are 
detected using the PC6000 or EcoWatch software from YSI. Notes are made of any 
unusual data during that deployment. Files are exported from EcoWatch in the 
comma-delimited format (.CSV) and opened in Microsoft Excel for pre-processing 
with EQWin format macro that was developed by the CDMO to reformat the header 
columns, insert station codes, insert a corrected time column and allow the 
technician to remove any pre- and post-deployment data from the file.  Where 
deployment overlap occurs between files, the data produced by the newly 
calibrated sonde is accepted as being the most accurate. The pre-processed file 
is then ready to be copied into the EQWin water.eqi file where the data 
are QA/QC checked and archived in a database. EQWin queries, reports and graphs 
are used to discover data set outliers (values which fall outside the range that 
the instrument is designed to measure) and large changes in the data. EQWin is 
also used to generate statistics, view graphs, create customized queries and 
reports of the data, cross query the water, weather and nutrient data and 
finally export the data to the CDMO. Persons responsible for data management are 
John Haskins and Allison Myers. 

3. Research objectives:
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a three to four week period at four 
sites in Elkhorn Slough. One site, South Marsh (SM), is in a relatively 
unimpacted side channel of the slough and the second, Azevedo Pond (AP), is in a 
pond that receives fertilizer and pesticide runoff from an adjoining strawberry 
field. The third site, North Marsh (NM), was added in April 1999 and is located 
in an area where there is both agricultural and non-agricultural runoff. The 
fourth site, Vierra Mouth, is located at the mouth of the slough and is used to 
identify oceanic influence. This site was added March 14 2001 at 13:00.  The 
purpose of this research is to identify the base parameters for Elkhorn Slough 
by using South Marsh as the control site while monitoring the two impacted sites 
(Azevedo Pond and North Marsh) for possible future problems.  

4. Research methods: 
The Elkhorn Slough water-monitoring program began in July 1995. All four sites 
described above are monitored simultaneously. Prior to YSI deployment at SM, a 
20-foot length of 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was placed in the slough to house the 
YSI. Holes were drilled in the pipe to remove 10% of the pipe's surface area and 
to allow water flow across the YSI. The pipe was positioned vertically in the 
slough with one end pushed into the soft bottom sediments and the other end 
secured to shore. A bolt in the pipe maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) 
above the bottom. This setup is exactly the same at North Marsh.  Prior to YSI 
deployment at AP, a supportive framework of rope and PVC was placed at the site 
to house the YSI. The structure maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) above 
the pond bottom. Every half hour over a 30-day period, measurements of specific 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, depth, turbidity, and pH 
are recorded. 30-day periods were chosen due to the limitations of the dissolved 
oxygen membrane and battery power. 

At the end of each 30-day period, the YSI is brought back into the lab for 
downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Data is downloaded onto a PC and 
graphs are printed using the PC 6000 software.  Sonde body and probes are 
cleaned.  DO membrane is changed and allowed to re-equilibrate for at least 
eight hours before calibration.  Calibration is performed as outlined in the YSI 
manual.  Buffer solutions of pH 7 and pH 10 are purchased from a scientific 
supply house and used for two-point calibration of the pH probe.  A salinity 
standard of 31.892 ppt was used for calibration of the conductivity probe and in 
the beginning of July 1999 a conductivity standard of 53 mS/cm was used. 
The turbidity probe is calibrated using a two-point calibration with DI water 
and 100 NTU standard. As of July 1998 a new YSI is calibrated in the lab in 
order to replace the previous one in the field. This eliminates the loss of data 
due to cleaning and calibration. QA/QC is done according to the CDMO manual by 
John Haskins using the macros provided by the CDMO.  Data are then looked over 
more rigorously to identify and document anomalies and missing data.  

5. Site location and character:
Elkhorn Slough is located on the West Coast of the United States in Central 
California. It connects with the Pacific Ocean in central Monterey Bay near Moss 
Landing, California. 

There are four sampling sites.  
AP (Azevedo Pond)(36° 50'44.64"N, 121° 45'13.24"W) is in a pond that receives 
fertilizer and pesticide runoff from a strawberry field in year-round 
production. The YSI is located about 10m from a culvert connecting the pond to 
the slough. Tide ranges from 0 to 1.4 meters and salinity ranges from 1.3 ppt 
during heavy runoff to 41.5 ppt during strong evaporation. The sonde is located 
approximately 10 cm off the bottom, which is composed of silty mud. Depth for 
this site is approximately 1 meter.

NM (North Marsh)(36° 50'04.75"N, 121° 44'18. 33"W) is located in between 
South Marsh and Azevedo Pond. This site is impacted by both agricultural and 
urban runoff. With a mean depth of 1 meter, the tide ranges from approximately 
0.05 to 0.87 meters. Salinity ranges between 20 and 40 parts per thousand and is 
affected by freshwater runoff from agriculture and upland runoff. The sonde is 
approximately 30 cm off the bottom, which is composed of silty mud.

SM (South Marsh)(36° 49'05.00"N, 121° 44'21.83"W) is located approximately 3 
km south of NM and is surrounded by mostly reserve land. This site receives 
runoff mostly from uplands with some runoff coming from cattle ranches. This 
site receives the least amount of pollution. The tidal range is from 0 to 3 
meters and the salinity range is from 27 to 34 parts per thousand. The sonde is 
approximately 30 cm off the bottom, which is composed of slightly compacted 
silty mud. Depth for this site is approximately 2 meters. 

The fourth site, VM (Vierra Mouth)(36° 48'39.95"N, 121° 44'45.40"W), is located 
at the mouth of the slough and is used to identify oceanic influence. With a 
mean depth of 2.5 meters, the tidal range is from 0.6 to 3.7 meters and salinity 
ranges from 26 to 36 parts per thousand. The sonde is located approximately 30 
cm off the bottom, which is composed of compacted mud and sand due to strong 
tidal currents. This site receives drainage from the entire watershed since it 
is at the mouth of the slough. There are several auto wreaking yards located 
approximately 2 km east of this site. 

6. Data collection period:
Sampling at Azevedo Pond and South Marsh began simultaneously at the end of 
June 1995 and data collection is ongoing. North Marsh began sampling on April 15 
1999. Vierra Mouth began sampling on March 14 2001 at 13:00.

Data columns are separated by tabs.  Each file contains a two line column header 
at the top of the page which identifies measurements and units for each column. 
Tabs separate data columns.

Dissolved Oxygen qualifier: The reliability of the dissolved oxygen (DO) data 
after 96 hours post-deployment for non-EDS (Extended Deployment System) data 
sondes may be problematic due to fouling which forms on the DO probe membrane 
during some deployments (Wenner et al. 2001). Many reserves have upgraded to the 
YSI 6600 EDS data sondes, which increases DO accuracy and longevity by reducing 
the environmental effects of fouling. The user is therefore advised to consult 
the metadata and to exercise caution when utilizing the DO data beyond the 
initial 96-hour time period. However, this potential drift is not always 
problematic for some uses of the data, i.e. periodicity analysis. It should also 
be noted that the amount of fouling is very site specific and that not all data 
are affected. The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR site should be 
contacted concerning the reliability of the DO data because of the site and 
seasonal variation in the fouling of the DO sensor. 

Depth qualifier: The NERR System-Wide Monitoring Program utilizes YSI data 
sondes that can be equipped with either depth or water level sensors. Both 
sensors measure water depth, but by convention, level sensors refer to 
atmospherically vented measurements and depth refers to non-vented measurements.  
Standard calibration protocols for the non-vented sensor use the atmospheric 
pressure at the time of calibration. Therefore, changes in atmospheric pressure 
between calibrations appear as changes in water depth. The error is equal to 
approximately 1.03 cm for every 1 millibar change in atmospheric pressure.  This 
error is eliminated for level sensors because they are vented to the atmosphere 
throughout the deployment time interval. If proper atmospheric pressure data is 
available, non-vented sensor depth measurements can be corrected for deployments 
between calibrations. Reading for both vented and non-vented are automatically 
compensated for water density changes due to variations in temperature 
and salinity. The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR site should be 
contacted in order to obtain information regarding atmospheric pressure data 
availability.

11. Anomalous/Suspect Data 

Azevedo Pond
1.	Suspect Data

January: There was a significant amount of rain that fell on Jan 09 (11.43 mm) 
and 10 (31.5 mm) that effected water quality at each site, specifically salinity 
from Jan 09 2030 through Jan 11 0200. 

February: The large increases in turbidity and decreases in salinity correspond 
with days of increased rain, February 12, 16, and 27.

March: The increase in salinity on March 24 at 10:30 is due to sonde 
replacement. Increased turbidity levels and decreased salinity data are a result 
of 0.7 inches of rainfall on March 15.

April: Increased turbidity and decreased salinity on April 4 correspond with 0.5 
inches of rainfall.

July:	Prior to sonde replacement on July 14 at 10:30, turbidity data is noisy 
but not altogether suspect. DO data are suspect from July 12 17:30 through the 
end of the deployment, July 14 1030 because readings were anomalously low and 
post deployment calibration was low also probably due to fouling on the 
membrane. 

September: The decrease in turbidity on September 8 at 09:00 corresponds to 
sonde replacement.

October: Turbidity data from October 4 at 11:30 through October 5 at 03:00 are 
suspect because they are incongruous with the following data but do not 
correlate to a rain event. 

November: Increases in turbidity and decreases in salinity data for November 7 
and November 8 correspond to rainfall events (0.54 inches on Nov 8).

All data except DO% are suspect from November 21 05:00 through the end of the 
month due to possible temperature probe failure. Temperature became erratic 
during this time, but the other parameters seemed to be reading within 
reasonable limits. 

December: Sharp decreases in salinity correspond to heavy rain events on 
December 6, 14, 19, 24, 25, and 29.

All data are suspect from December 29 at 17:00 through December 30 02:00 due to 
1.37 inches of rainfall on December 29.

All data except DO% are suspect from December 01 00:00 through the end of the 
month due to possible temperature probe failure. Temperature became erratic 
during this time, but the other parameters seemed to be reading within 
reasonable limits.

North Marsh
1.	Suspect data

January: There was a significant amount of rain that fell on Jan 09 (11.43 mm) 
and 10 (31.5 mm) which affected water quality at each site. 

February: Turbidity data from February 22 at 11:00 through 21:00 are suspect 
because they are incongruous with the following data but do not correspond to 
rain events or sonde replacement.
Decreases in salinity and increases in turbidity on February 27 and 28 are a 
result of a rain event.

March: Salinity data from March 7 at 03:00 through the end of the deployment, 
March 17 10:30 are suspect because while they do correspond with a rain event, 
they are incongruous with the preceding and following data.

April: Turbidity probe is still having parking issues on Apr 01 but appears to 
correct itself after this date.

May:	May salinity data are suspect towards the end of the deployment because 
the data are incongruous from the end of the first deployment to the beginning 
of the second deployment May 12 1030-1100. Also the salinity probe read 30.38 in 
53 ms/cm in the post deployment check.

June:	Dissolved oxygen data from June 14 06:00 through June 20 05:30 is suspect 
due to low and decreasing values.

July:	The sudden decrease in depth data from July 8 at 10:30 is suspect due to 
probe misplacement.Sudden increases in turbidity from July 25 04:00- 16:00 and 
July 26 02:00-13:30 are suspect because they are incongruous with following data 
and do not correspond to rain events or sonde replacement.

August: No suspect data for this month.

September: Salinity and dissolved oxygen data from September 7 21:30 through 
September 29 09:00 are suspect because they are incongruous with preceding and 
following data and do not correspond to a rain event or sonde replacement.

October: The sudden decrease in depth on October 27 14:00 is due to probe 
misplacement.

November: A sudden decrease in salinity on November 8 corresponds to a rain 
event.

December: Turbidity data from December 15 at 12:30 through December 22 at 13:30 
are suspect as they are incongruous with the preceding and following data.  On 
December 23 a high tide (7.0) with a low pressure system breached the sandbag 
levee subjecting the North Marsh to increased tidal regimes through the end of 
the month. The decrease in salinity data beginning on December 24 and lasting 
throughout the rest of the month correspond to rain events.

South Marsh
1.	Suspect data

January: There was a significant amount of rain that fell on Jan 09 (11.43 mm) 
and 10 (31.5 mm) which affected water quality at each site.

February: Dissolved oxygen data on Feb 18 from 17:00 to 19:00 are suspect due to 
anomalously low values.
The decreases in salinity and increases in turbidity data on February 15 and 27 
correspond to rain events.

April:	Data are suspect due to a large decrease in dissolved oxygen and an 
increase in salinity that occurred on April 7 at 9:00 during a sonde 
replacement.

May:	Salinity data from May 5 11:00 through May 24 03:00 are suspect due to 
probe drift and conductivity and salinity data are suspect at the end of the 
first deployment May 5 11:00 due to an increase in salinity but a decrease in 
conductivity. 

June:	Dissolved oxygen data from June 14 at 06:30 through June 18 at 16:00 are 
suspect because they are anomalously high for unknown reasons. 
Increased values for turbidity roughly correspond with replacement of the sonde 
on June 30.

July:	Salinity and conductivity data from July 10 15:30 through July 28 at 08:30 
are suspect as they were reading low post-calibration and probably influenced by 
probe drift.  
The sudden increase in salinity and slight increase in dissolved oxygen on July 
28 at 08:30 is due to sonde replacement.

August: Dissolved oxygen data are suspect on August 2 from 07:30 through August 
8 13:30 due to anomalously low values that are possibly due to a probe/ membrane 
malfunction. 
Salinity and conductivity data between August 1 00:00 and August 25 0900 are 
suspect due to incongruously low values that continue to decline. The sudden 
increase in salinity on August 25 11:00 corresponds to sonde replacement. 
Salinity data after August 25 11:30 (time of sonde replacement) also decline, 
possibly due to a probe drift.

September: All data on September 7 from 16:30 through 21:30 are suspect due to a 
slippage of the marsh bank and subsequent plume of sediment.
Salinity and conductivity data are suspect from the beginning of the month 
through the end of the deployment Sept 22 10:00, due to probe drift.

October: Salinity and conductivity data exhibits a sudden increase in salinity

suspect from the beginning of the month through the end of the deployment due to 
probe drift.  Salinity and conductivity are also suspect from October 22 17:30 
through the end of the month due to probe drift. 
pH data from October 25 17:00, October 26 17:30, and October 27 18:00 through 
18:30 are suspect due to low values that possibly correspond with out-of-water 
events. 

November: The sudden increase in salinity on November 17 at 13:30 corresponds 
with sonde replacement thus salinity and conductivity are suspect from the 
beginning of the month through the end of the first deployment November 17 
11:00.

1.	Suspect data

January: There was a significant amount of rain that fell on Jan 09 (11.43 mm) 
and 10 (31.5 mm) which affected water quality at each site. 

February: Salinity data are suspect from February 1 00:00 through the end of the 
first deployment (Feb 03 1430) due to incongruous readings with the following 
deployment. 

March: Salinity data are suspect from approximately March 11 0900 through March 
15 1830 because of a muted signal then a sudden 1 PSU drop on March 15, which 
corresponds with a heavy rain event. 
DO data are suspect from March 26 04:00 through the end of the month because of 
a downward trend in the data. 

April:  DO data are suspect from the beginning of the month through April 7 
02:30 due to previously mentioned downward trend in the data. 

July:  Dissolved oxygen data from July 10 21:00 through July 21 08:30 is suspect 
due to decreasing values. 

August: An increase in salinity on August 19 at 14:30 is due to sonde 
replacement.

September: September salinity data prior to sonde replacement (September 1 00:00 
through September 15 11:00) is suspect due to a muted signal.

December: A large dip in measured depth occurs between December 8 13:00 and 
December 10 04:00. This corresponds to a change in deployments and is therefore 
suspect due to possible problems with the sonde replacement.

14.	Other Remarks/Notes
Though measurements are not abnormal, dissolved oxygen post deployment 
calibration for AP 6/16 11:00 through 7/14 10:30 is extremely low and the probe 
was encrusted with mud and invertebrates.
